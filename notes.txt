Dialog system notes
--------------------
I need to write a dialog tree builder and I want to use method chaining to do so for this I will need a modular
process the process so far is input the root than input an array of options than choose which indexed option
to manipulate to get the results we want.

TO-DO:
    * Navigating dialogs
    * Dialog builder using method chaining
    * Proper commenting
    * TUI implementation
    * Write unit tests
    - Error display in TUI
    - Dialog creation in TUI


What have I learned:
    * Yield and generator methods
    * Class attributes and instance attributes
    * Some DOM and widgets for web design frameworks
    * Textual basics
    * List comprehension
    * What MyPy is
    * Type hints
    * Error handling
    * __eq__ dunder method to make object behave like data
    * String quote symbol consistency
    * Same data different objects are False in '=='
    * Same data different objects in two lists of equal length are True in '=='
    * How to write unit tests
    * Beartype and run-time type checking in Python
